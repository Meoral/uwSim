# uwSim
Underwater image simulation


## Dependencies

To succesffuly run the scripts in this project the following dependencies need to be 
installed.

* [RenderToolbox4](http://rendertoolbox.org) - a set of Matlab tools to create, manipulate and
render complex 3D scene files.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - RenderToolbox4 uses either Mitsuba or PBRT renderers to 
produce final images. Rather than install these programs we provide their dockerized implementations.
A cross-platform Docker engine is required to run these.
* [CVX](http://cvxr.com/) - a Matlab toolbox for convex optimization.
* [ISET](http://imageval.com) - Image Systems Engineering Toolbox for camera sensor simulations.
